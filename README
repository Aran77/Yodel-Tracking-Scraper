The Yodel API was not available to us, we needed another way to gather consignment tracking details en mass.

This script takes a CSV file of consignments shipped with Yodel, loads the tracking webpage for each and scrapes the status and a few other bits of information.
We can scrape a 'Delivered on' date and calculate the days in transit, also we can monitor how long undelivered items have been in the network and highlight potential delays.

TO DO: 
Try using BeautifulSoup4 instead of selenium. *** DONE ***
Keep list of undelivered items and count days since posted *** DONE ***
Set up script on a daily chron *** DONE ***
Import from FTP, using Linnwork order managment to export the previous days processed orders to ftp *** DONE ***
